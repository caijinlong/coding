As we know facebook always asks questions from graph theory he asked me this problem to code- 
there is a grid of n*n where each cell represent an Island or and some of these are very dangerous so u have to avoid these during path selections.You can move up,down,left ,right.You are given your starting position ,positions of dangerous Islands and position some specific Islands.Your task is to deliver a message to all the specific Islands in minimum number of moves to all specific Islands(NOTE- there are also chances that no moves are possible to cover all specific Island ,in such case you have to tell "NOT POSSIBLE TO DELIVER ALL ",otherwise output minimum moves).

A:
This is similar to the Travelling Salesman problem, which is NP-hard. 

- If the number S of specific islands is quite small, say <= 20, we can perform S+1 Breadth First Searches to find all pairs of distances between the S islands and the initial position. Then, we can check all permutations of the S islands and calculate the cost of the possible paths "Initial pos -> Island_1 -> .. Island_S" using the distances calculated above. We can use dynamic programming to find the best path. The DP state can be the current specific island and a bitmask with the covered islands so far. 
The running time will be O(S^2 * 2^S + S * N^2). 
Note that 2^20 is about 1 million which allows this solution to be fast
